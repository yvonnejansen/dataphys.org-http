It was long known that an optimal arch follows an inverted catenary curve, i.e., an upside-down hanging chain. Gaudí&#39;s upside-down physical models took him years to build but gave him more flexibility to explore organic designs, since every adjustment would immediately trigger the &#34;physical recomputation&#34; of optimal arches. He would turn the model upright by the way of a mirror placed underneath or by taking photographs.  Sources:   memetician (2007) A different kind of string theory: Antoni Gaudi.

They were not meant to be visually examined, but were used in mechanical analog computers for aiming battleship guns during WWII. They were also called computing cams.  Mechanical fire control aids started to be developed in the 1900s and and were still in use in the late 1980s. During WWII, they could solve multivariate calculus problems in real-time. While cams were used for hard-coded functions, gears were used for arithmetic calculations and other specialized devices were used for multiplication and differential calculus. The design of these analog computers is clearly explained in the video and PDFs linked below.  The oldest known mechanical analog computer is from 150BC (see our entry greek orrery). Cams were already used in 300BC to control automata, and were further developed in the 13th century by polymath Ismail al-Jazari.  Sources:   US Navy (1953) Basic Mechanisms in Fire Control Computers (Video).   US Navy (1944) Basic Fire Control Mechanisms (PDF files).

    <div class="hidden full-text">      Alexander Dewdney is a Canadian mathematician and computer scientist who authored the recreational mathematics column in the Scientific American magazine from 1984 to 1991, after Martin Gardner and Douglas Hofstadter. In 1984, he describes a number of imaginary analog computers he calls &#34;Analog Gadgets&#34;, which can in principle solve computing problems instantly. The first one, shown on the left image, uses spaghetti to sort numbers. The second one uses strings to find the shortest path in a graph. The third one uses nails and a rubber band to find the convex hull. The last one illustrated here uses soap bubbles to solve the Steiner tree problem.  Dewdney admits that most of these ideas were not new and were &#34;part of computer science folklore, passed around by word of mouth and rarely described in the literature&#34;. His Scientific American article and a book he later wrote in 1993 helped popularize the ideas. These analog gadgets were only thought experiments and were never meant to be put into actual use. Still, before digital computers took over, analog computers were used to solve real problems such as the control of battleship guns.  Also see our other entries on physical computation, including Christian Freksa&#39;s use of a 3D printer to solve the shortest path problem.  Sources:   A. K. Dewney (1984) Computer recreations - On the spaghetti computer and other analog gadgets for problem solving. Scientific American. June 1984, Volume 250, Issue 6. pp. 19--26.   A. K. Dewdney (1993) Analog Computation - Spaghetti Computers, in The (New) Turing Omnibus–66 Excursions in Computer Science. pp. 223--229.

Their setup called &#34;liquid brain&#34; consists in a transparent water tank suspended over an overhead projector and four LEGO motors. Input values are sent to the motors which vibrate the water.

    <div class="hidden full-text">    Can a slime mold solve the traveling salesman problem without a digital computer? From the article&#39;s abstract:   The plasmodium phase of Physarum polycephalum is a champion amongst living creatures used in laboratory prototypes of future and emergent computing architectures. A wide range of problems from computational geometry and logic can be solved by this cellular slime mold. A typical way to perform a computation with the slime mold is to represent a problem’s data as a spatial configuration of nutrients and allow the slime mold to span the nutrients with its protoplasmic network. The architecture of the network represents a solution to the problem. We use a similar approach and exploit foraging behavior of P. polycephalum to imitate the formation of the United States transport network in laboratory conditions. Major urban areas are represented with rolled oats, the plasmodium is inoculated in one urban area, we wait until all oat flakes are colonized by the plasmodium, and then the protoplasmic network developed by the plasmodium is analyzed. The slime mold’s networks are compared with the interstate network and the networks are analyzed in terms of proximity graphs.   Source: Andrew Adamatzky and Andrew Ilachinski (2012) Slime Mold Imitates the United States Interstate System. </div>
