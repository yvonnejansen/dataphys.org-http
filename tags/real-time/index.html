    <div class="hidden full-text">    x.pose is a dynamic wearable data sculpture that makes the collection of the wearer&#39;s location data visible in real-time in the physical world.  From the project webpage:   x.pose is a wearable data-driven sculpture that exposes a person&#39;s skin as a real-time reflection of the data that the wearer is producing. In the physical realm we can deliberately control which portions our bodies are exposed to the world by covering it with clothing. In the digital realm, we have much less control of what personal aspects we share with the services that connect us. In the digital realm we are naked and vulnerable.     How it was created and how it works:   The first step was to build a mobile app and server to automatically collect my data over time. Done using Node.js and PhoneGap.  Second: the recorded data set was used as the basis for the generative aspects of the personalized wearable couture. The output is an abstract 3D mesh armature of my location data points collected over about a month. The dataset was fed into processing to produce the pattern and exported to Rhino to make the 3D mesh.  Lastly, the mobile app and server is used to provide real-time data transmission through bluetooth to an Arduino, which controls reactive displays that change in opacity to reveal the wearer’s skin. This occurs in proportion to the volume of information that is passively generated.   Source: x.pose is a thesis project for the ITP program at the Tisch School of the Arts, NYU, by Xuedi Chen in collaboration with Pedro G. C. Oliveira. </div>
