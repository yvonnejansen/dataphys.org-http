Je vous ferai toucher au doigt et à l&#39;œil tous les défauts de cette place, qui sont en bon nombre [...].”  There is a relief of Namur in the Tuileries, I would ask you to kindly come with me. I will make you touch with your finger and your eye all the defects of this place, which are in good number.  — Vauban&#39;s letter to Le Pelletier, president of the constituent assembly (1695).    “Le Moniteur parle d&#39;un plan de la Suisse, du feu général Pfiffer. Faites examiner ce plan, et, s&#39;il est meilleur que celui que j&#39;ai acheté dernièrement, faites-le acheter et transporter à Paris. Comme il est possible que nous ayons encore la guerre, il n&#39;y a point de meilleure carte que ces plans en relief.”  The Monitor speaks about a map of Switzerland, from the late general Pfiffer. Have this map examined, and if it is better than the one I bought recently, have it bought and transported to Paris. Since it is possible that we may still have war, there is no better map than these relief maps.  — Napoléon&#39;s letter to Maréchal Berthier (1805).

It was long known that an optimal arch follows an inverted catenary curve, i.e., an upside-down hanging chain. Gaudí&#39;s upside-down physical models took him years to build but gave him more flexibility to explore organic designs, since every adjustment would immediately trigger the &#34;physical recomputation&#34; of optimal arches.

    <div class="hidden full-text">     These cams are solid models of bivariate and univariate mathematical functions plotted in cylindric coordinates (left and middle images) and polar coordinates (right image). They were not meant to be visually examined, but were used in mechanical analog computers for aiming battleship guns during WWII. They were also called computing cams.  Mechanical fire control aids started to be developed in the 1900s and and were still in use in the late 1980s. During WWII, they could solve multivariate calculus problems in real-time. While cams were used for hard-coded functions, gears were used for arithmetic calculations and other specialized devices were used for multiplication and differential calculus. The design of these analog computers is clearly explained in the video and PDFs linked below.  The oldest known mechanical analog computer is from 150BC (see our entry greek orrery). Cams were already used in 300BC to control automata, and were further developed in the 13th century by polymath Ismail al-Jazari.  Sources:   US Navy (1953) Basic Mechanisms in Fire Control Computers (Video).   US Navy (1944) Basic Fire Control Mechanisms (PDF files).

    <div class="hidden full-text">      Alexander Dewdney is a Canadian mathematician and computer scientist who authored the recreational mathematics column in the Scientific American magazine from 1984 to 1991, after Martin Gardner and Douglas Hofstadter. In 1984, he describes a number of imaginary analog computers he calls &#34;Analog Gadgets&#34;, which can in principle solve computing problems instantly. The first one, shown on the left image, uses spaghetti to sort numbers. The second one uses strings to find the shortest path in a graph. The third one uses nails and a rubber band to find the convex hull. The last one illustrated here uses soap bubbles to solve the Steiner tree problem.  Dewdney admits that most of these ideas were not new and were &#34;part of computer science folklore, passed around by word of mouth and rarely described in the literature&#34;. His Scientific American article and a book he later wrote in 1993 helped popularize the ideas. These analog gadgets were only thought experiments and were never meant to be put into actual use. Still, before digital computers took over, analog computers were used to solve real problems such as the control of battleship guns.  Also see our other entries on physical computation, including Christian Freksa&#39;s use of a 3D printer to solve the shortest path problem.  Sources:   A. K. Dewney (1984) Computer recreations - On the spaghetti computer and other analog gadgets for problem solving. Scientific American. June 1984, Volume 250, Issue 6. pp. 19--26.   A. K. Dewdney (1993) Analog Computation - Spaghetti Computers, in The (New) Turing Omnibus–66 Excursions in Computer Science. pp. 223--229.

    Dutch artist Peter Jansen creates sculptures of moving characters by merging successive snapshots into a single monolithic object. These are not physical visualizations as they do not display data, but the technique could certainly inspire the creation of physical visualizations for complex temporal data.  The idea of merging time slices is reminiscent of the pioneering work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s on chronophotography. See our entry on Marey&#39;s movement sculptures.

    Mount Saint Helens is an active volcano located in the north-west of the United States. In an eruption in 1980, the upper section of the volcano was destroyed, reducing the peak&#39;s elevation from 2950 m to 2549 m. This two-part 3D printed model of Mount Saint Helens visualizes the dramatic change that occurred over a very short period of time.  The digital data for 3D printing and the white and red model were prepared by Drew Thompson, the green model was printed by Jeppe Vestergaard. [&hellip;]</p>

    This table created by the furniture design company Duffy London is a geological cross-section of the sea shown with layered wood and glass sheets. Designer Christopher Duffy got the idea while visiting a glass factory and noticing that glass sheets darken as more layers as added, as does the sea. You can have this piece of furniture at home for £9,800.  Sources:   Duffy London (2014) Abyss Table.   Nina Azzarello (2014) Duffy London layers the abyss table to look like ocean depths.   </p>

There is not much information available online but Andrew explained to us by e-mail:   It was so long ago that I wouldn’t be able to remember the scale or locations I am afraid. Apart from the fact that the model was based on Piraeus in Greece.  I called it the Rotary model. It was a collection of research undertaken to understand an architectural site, before actually visiting it. Each segment could be rotated to view each piece individually. This segment was used to understand the scale of the site by comparison, by sliding each map, known locations can be compared to the unknown, allowing a simple understanding of its spatial makeup.   Sources:   Andrew Chard (2015) Year 3/ Semester 1/ Rotary model.

This original project results in beautiful data visualizations collaboratively crafted by a human and a bee colony! Here&#39;s how it works:   Because a colony will follow the queen bee and build a hive based on the pheromones that she releases, Ri is able to move the queen such that the others in the colony act accordingly.

More details on the project can be found on the Flowing Data blog [1]:   The three-part series is called Yuansu, which translates to &#34;a comprehension of the gestalt of life&#34;. One part is a collection of abstract sculptures, and another is a performance with the bees themselves. But the first part, which Ri and the bees created back in 2008, is a series of geographic maps.   Ren Ri&#39;s beeswax sculptures were exhibited at Pearl Lam Galleries Soho unti April 12, 2015.
